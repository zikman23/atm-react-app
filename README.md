# ATM React App Exercise

## Overview

This is a simple React app that presents the user with an ATM-like interface, with options to deposit or withdraw money, as well as display the current account balance. The goals of this exercise include:

1. Implement user-friendly UI and React components
2. Manage state of various UI elements
3. Validate form content in conjunction with state of other components

This was created to submit for an assignment in Module 15 of the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development course (Fall 2022).

## Details & Improvements

The exercise included the following details, which are implemented in the app:

- Adding validation so users canâ€™t withdraw more money than the account balance
- Modifying the user interface to require users to select deposit or withdraw before an input field is visible

I styled the app using basic CSS in order to give it a cleaner interface.

I attempted to implement dropdown menus and buttons using Bootstrap, but was unsuccessful at the time of submission. I plan to go back and complete the UI improvements.

This React app has been deployed to GitHub Pages using `gh-pages` by following the information provided [here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

It is viewable on the web without having to download and run it locally. However, the source code is also provided if you choose to do so. More information is below.

## React Toolchains

I converted this exercise to a React app by using `create-react-app`. Information can be found here: [**Create React App**](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
